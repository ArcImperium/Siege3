The full website is not finished.
Teh website is pretty straightforward. 
Just click on a button on the home page, then from there you can click on another button to wither create, edit, load, or select a review question set.
You can click the review questions button and it will review the questions.
Again it is not fully finished, you cannot use it fully yet.
